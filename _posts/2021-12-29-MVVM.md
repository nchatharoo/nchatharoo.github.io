## Introduction :

MVVM is a UI architectural pattern, and it stands for Model-View-ViewModel. MVVM is an MVC variant created by Microsoft, that aims to minimize the boilerplate of syncing View events and Model updates that Controllers hold.

With the help of a ViewModel component, Microsoft's MVVM solution seamlessly connects View events with Model updates.

Developers declare the ViewModel bindings along with the View declarations in XAML, and the framework handles the runtime bindings automatically, according to Microsoft's.NET graphics system.

Because most platforms don't offer the automated wiring that the .NET graphics system offers, MVVM is often known as Model-View-Binder outside of Microsoft systems.

In UIKit, for example, there is no mechanism to automatically connect a ViewModel to a View, therefore the developer must implement the Binder components. It's usual to use frameworks like RxSwift or Combine (or closures !) to make the connections between the View and the ViewModel easier.



## Comparing MVC and MVVM :

![MVC-MVVM](https://nchatharoo.github.io/images/2021-12-29-MVC-MVVM.png)

The only difference between the MVC and MVVM structures is that a ViewModel does not hold a reference to the View as the Controller does in MVC.

To make both the View and the ViewModel more reusable, they should not be directly dependent on one other. Through a binding mechanism, they should be able to communicate in an indirect manner. 

UIViewControllers are ideal candidates for acting as Binders in UIKit, linking the View to the ViewModel. This is because in order to show views on the screen in UIKit, your app must have at least one UIViewController.

Since UIViewControllers already have a reference to their corresponding Views, they’re a great place to inject and bind the ViewModel with the View.

But, in UIKit, MVVM won't reduce a lot of boilerplate code since there’s no automatic binding. Still, ViewModels are an good idea to create a reusable logic between UI and core components and a better architectural separation. It’s recommended for ViewModels to be platform and framework-agnostic so that we can reuse them on multiple platforms.



## MVVM in practice :

Imagine a simple ViewController :

```swift
final class ViewController: NSObject {

  private(set) lazy var view: UIRefreshControl = {
      let view = UIRefreshControl()
        view.addTarget(self, action: #selector(refresh), for: .valueChanged)
        return view
  }()

  private let loader: ModelLoader

  var onRefresh: (([Model]) -> Void)?

  init(loader: ModelLoader) {
        self.loader = loader
  }

  @objc func refresh() {
        view.beginRefreshing()
        loader.load { [weak self] result in
                if let model = try? result.get() {
                self?.onRefresh?(model)
            }
            self?.view.endRefreshing()
        }
    }
}
```

We can see that the ViewController is communicating with the ModelLoader, it also manage the model loading state with the var onRefresh and it create and configure a UIRefreshControl.
The goal is to move some responsibilities out of the ViewController to a ViewModel.
There is two common ways to create a ViewModel, stateful and stateless.



## Stateful version:

So the ViewModel can be on multiple kind of state (loading, pending, etc...) and we notify the observer any change on the state with a simple closure (`onChange`).
We also define the state transitions by setting the `var state` in the `loadModel()` method. Since the state is private, we expose accessors for the current state of the ViewModel with `isLoading` (a switch statement is enought in this case) and a computed var to access the model, if it's loaded, we return the model otherwise we return nil.

```swift

final class ViewModel {
    private let loader: ModelLoader
    
    init(loader: ModelLoader) {
        self.loader = loader
    }
    
    private enum State {
        case loading
        case pending
        case loaded([Model])
        case failure
    }
    
    private var state = State.pending {
        didSet { onChange?(self) }
    }
    
    var onChange: ((ViewModel) -> Void)?
    
    var isLoading: Bool {
        switch state {
            case .loading: return true
            case .pending, .loaded, .failure: return false
        }
    }
    
    var model: [Model]? {
        switch state {
        case .loaded(let model):
            return model
        case .loading, .pending, .failure:
            return nil
        }
    }
    
    func loadModel() {
        state = .loading
        loader.load { [weak self] result in
            if let model = try? result.get() {
                self?.state = .loaded(model)
            } else {
                self?.state = .failed
            }
        }
    }
}
```

That's all we need in the ViewModel, but what about the ViewController ? 
First we replace the `ModelLoader` reference with a `viewModel` property. 
Secondly in the `refresh` function we set the `onChange` callback to get a `viewModel` and its `isLoading` property to determine if we need to refresh or not. 
Thirdly, we need to see if we have a model in the ViewModel, and pass it with the `onRefresh` closure. 
And finally, we tell the ViewModel to load the model

```swift
final class ViewController: NSObject {
    private(set) lazy var view: UIRefreshControl = {
        let view = UIRefreshControl()
        view.addTarget(self, action: #selector(refresh), for: .valueChanged)
        return view
    }()

    private let viewModel: ViewModel
    
    var onRefresh: (([Model]) -> Void)?
    
    init(viewModel: ViewModel) {
        self.viewModel = viewModel
    }
    
    @objc func refresh() {
        viewModel.onChange = { [weak self] viewModel in
            if viewModel.isLoading {
                self?.view.beginRefreshing()
            } else {
                self?.view.endRefreshing()
            }
            
            if let model = viewModel.model {
                self?.onRefresh?(model)
            }
        }
        viewModel.loadModel()
    }
}
```

So the  `onChange` closure is the binding logic between our the ViewModel and the View, happening in the ViewController. We can even  wrap the closure in a `binded` function, so the View is a binded UIRefreshControl:

```swift
    
private(set) lazy var view = binded(UIRefreshControl()) 

private func binded(_ view: UIRefreshControl) -> UIRefreshControl {
      viewModel.onChange = { [weak self] viewModel in
          if viewModel.isLoading {
              self?.view.beginRefreshing()
          } else {
              self?.view.endRefreshing()
          }

          if let model = viewModel.model {
              self?.onRefresh?(model)
          }
      }
      view.addTarget(self, action: #selector(refresh), for: .valueChanged)
		  return view
}
```

Notice the last lines of code, we don't set the `viewModel` as a target action with the view. That's because the target action pattern force the instance to be an NSObject, and conforming to NSObject is a UIKit requirement. View models should be platform agnostic, by making the ViewModel subclass of NSObject, we leak implementation detail just to satisfy UIKit. 
By keeping `self`, it's the ViewController that forward the message to the ViewModel.

There is another code smell, the `onRefresh` reference the Model ! We can move this logic to the ViewModel, because the ViewController is only passing the `model`, it does nothing with it.

```swift
final class ViewController: NSObject {
    private(set) lazy var view = binded(UIRefreshControl()) 
    
    private let viewModel: ViewModel
        
    init(viewModel: ViewModel) {
        self.viewModel = viewModel
    }
    
    @objc func refresh() {
        viewModel.loadModel()
    }
    
    private func binded(_ view: UIRefreshControl) -> UIRefreshControl {
        viewModel.onChange = { [weak self] viewModel in
            if viewModel.isLoading {
                self?.view.beginRefreshing()
            } else {
                self?.view.endRefreshing()
            }
        }
        view.addTarget(self, action: #selector(refresh), for: .valueChanged)
    }
}
```

Now our ViewController does not manage any state, it binds the View to the ViewModel. All the state management now live in a stateful version of the ViewModel. 

We don't need to hold the model state, by just forwarding it to the `onRefresh` closure, we can get rid of 
`self?.state = .loaded(model)` 
We still need to update the View, so the new state is `.pending`. So we end up with two state, either loading or pending.
And because we have only two state, a simple boolean `isLoading` is enough, we can remove the `State` enum and the `model` computed var.

```swift
final class ViewModel {
    private let loader: ModelLoader
    
    init(loader: ModelLoader) {
        self.loader = loader
    }
    
    var onChange: ((ViewModel) -> Void)?
    var onRefresh: (([Model]) -> Void)?

    private(set) var isLoading: Bool = false {
        didSet { onChange?(self) }
    }
    
    func loadModel() {
        isLoading = true
        loader.load { [weak self] result in
            if let model = try? result.get() {
                self?.onRefresh?(model)
            }
        isLoading = false
        }
    }
}
```

Let's transform the ViewModel to a stateless version.



## Stateless version:

We can see that the ViewModel hold state with the `isLoading` boolean, to get a transient state we can use an closure observer for each state.

```swift
final class ViewModel {
    private let loader: ModelLoader
    
    init(loader: ModelLoader) {
        self.loader = loader
    }
  
    var onRefresh: (([Model]) -> Void)?
    var onLoadingStateChange: ((Bool) -> Void)?
        
    func loadModel() {
        onLoadingStateChange?(true)
        loader.load { [weak self] result in
            if let model = try? result.get() {
                self?.onRefresh?(model)
            }
            onLoadingStateChange?(false)
        }
    }
}
```

By having a `onLoadingStateChange` we can pass the state transition in the closure. And in the ViewController we have this now :

```swift
final class ViewController: NSObject {
    private(set) lazy var view = binded(UIRefreshControl()) 
    
    private let viewModel: ViewModel
        
    init(viewModel: ViewModel) {
        self.viewModel = viewModel
    }
    
    @objc func refresh() {
        viewModel.loadModel()
    }
    
    private func binded(_ view: UIRefreshControl) -> UIRefreshControl {
        viewModel.onLoadingStateChange = { [weak view] isLoading in
            if isLoading {
                view?.beginRefreshing()
            } else {
                view?.endRefreshing()
            }
        }
        view.addTarget(self, action: #selector(refresh), for: .valueChanged)
    }
}
```

In the `binded` function we set the `onLoadingStateChange`  pass a boolean, and weakify view, since we do not need a reference to self.



## Bonus 1: Generics and typealias

In the ViewModel, we can use Generics and typealias, that way we do not leave room for assumptions.

```swift
final class ViewModel {
    typealias Observer<T> = (T) -> Void
    
    private let loader: ModelLoader
    
    init(loader: ModelLoader) {
        self.loader = loader
    }
    
    var onRefresh: Observer<Model>?
    var onLoadingStateChange: Observer<Bool>?
        
    func loadModel() {
        onLoadingStateChange?(true)
        loader.load { [weak self] result in
            if let model = try? result.get() {
                self?.onRefresh?(model)
            }
            onLoadingStateChange?(false)
        }
    }
}
```



## Bonus 2: RxSwift

In the ViewController, we can use frameworks like RxSwift, instead of a closure:

```swift
private(set) lazy var view = binded(UIRefreshControl())
private let disposeBag = DisposeBag()

private func binded(_ view: UIRefreshControl) -> UIRefreshControl {
    view.rx.controlEvent(.valueChanged)
            .bind(to: viewModel.loadModel)
            .disposed(by: disposeBag)

    viewModel.isLoading
        .bind(to: view.rx.isRefreshing)
        .dispose(by: disposeBag)

    return view
}
```
